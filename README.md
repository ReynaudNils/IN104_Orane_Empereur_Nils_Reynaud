# IN104_Orane_Empereur_Nils_Reynaud
Welcome to ou IN104 Projet 4!
We mainly studied a tabular dataset in this project, and were able to implement PDP, SHAP and LIME on it. The first two were directly written with Python (Anaconda) and so the command python name_file.py should be enough to make them work, obviously in a folder containing the dataset as well. Luckily, the dataset titanic is also in the zip file containing all the codes. The LIME method was implemented on a notebook. We also tried to implement the ICE method(with python directly) but couldn't make it work because anaconda refused to update scikit-learn, which was necessary.
We then studied a text dataset, mainly with LIME, also on a notebook. We tried several other methods but for various reasons could not make any of them work.
